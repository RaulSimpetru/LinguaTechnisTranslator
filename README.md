## Praise the Omnissiah!
For a very long time, we have been contemplating a way of translating our sacred language to the likes of the non-augmented citizens of the Imperium.  

Today the Omnissiah revealed to Archmagos Tronstad a hidden chamber underneath one forge that exploded after a failure in one of the cogitators. Inside he has been able to find an almost STC like cogitator that was severely damaged. Until the time of this recording, he has only been able to recover one piece of information.  

A pre-golden age human has been given sacred information from the **Omnissiah** and created a holy binary encoder and decoder. Such intellect will easily make him today an Archmagos if not a Fabricator General. His code is written in one of the holiest languages we have ever come across and is also one of the easiest to use.  

### +++BEGINNIG QUOTATION FORM ORIGINAL FILE+++
Encode: 	python Encoder.py file_name.wav ‘holy message’  
Decode:	python Decoder.py file_name.wav
### +++ENDING QUOTATION FORM ORIGINAL FILE+++

This new information will be crucial to our understanding of the non-augmented and how we can improve ourselves by learning more about how they think.
